# UnicamTools

A suite of simplified tools for climate analysis and urban comfort studies, built on top of [Ladybug Tools](https://www.ladybug.tools/). The suite provides an intuitive graphical interface that hides the complexity of Grasshopper and Ladybug Tools workflows.

## Overview

UnicamTools consists of four color-coded tools, each designed for specific tasks:

- **White Tool**: Performs quick statistical analysis to define representative days for hot and cold scenarios
- **Green Tool**: Integrates custom weather data (analyzed with the White Tool) into EPW weather files
- **Orange Tool**: Applies urban heat island effects to study scenarios using MIT's Urban Weather Generator
- **Blue Tool**: Conducts shadow analysis, radiation studies, and UTCI thermal comfort calculations

## Features

- Simplified user interface for complex climate analysis workflows
- Integration with Ladybug Tools ecosystem
- Automated processing of weather data and urban comfort metrics
- Visual outputs for easy interpretation of results

## Project Context

UnicamTools was developed as part of the [CLICCHE Erasmus+ Project](https://clicche.org), aimed at improving climate change education and analysis tools.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Reorganize all clusters and groups into separate folders using Hops
- [ ] Develop enhanced UX interface for tools
- [ ] Create comprehensive dependencies list
